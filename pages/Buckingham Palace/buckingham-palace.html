      Buckingham Palace is a royal residence in London, and the administrative
      headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom.[a][2] Located in the
      City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions
      and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at
      times of national rejoicing and mourning.

      Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's
      palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a
      site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was
      acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen
      Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th century
      it was enlarged by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed
      three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the
      London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria
      in 1837.
